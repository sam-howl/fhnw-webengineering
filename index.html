		<h1>Recipes Project</h1>
		<p>
			This web application is used to manage recipes. The page has an About page to describe the purpose of this
			web application. On the Recipes page all created recipes are displayed. The user has the possibility to make
			use of the default controls like, creating, displaying, updating and deleting a recipe. A recipe consists of
			a name, a description, a list with ingredients, a category, the time to make it and the URL to a picture. In
			the create dialog the user can add the ingredients to a list. In the update dialog the user has the possibility
			to change the information of an ingredient, remove an ingredient and add new ingredients. In both dialogs
			that take user input the validation is made, for example that the input does not exceed 255 symbols or that
			only numbers can be entered. The delete dialog asks if the recipe should really be removed, so the user has
			the possibility to cancel the deletion.<br /><br />
			I did not add the difficulty level, because it is a useless information. Even a difficult dish can be easily
			done by a beginner when the recipe is good enough. Therefore, I concentrated more on challenges like the update dialog.<br /><br />
            Now a few screenshots of the web application are following...<br />
