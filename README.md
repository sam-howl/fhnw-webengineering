# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Project idea short description: I'd like to create a web application for receipts. The receipt consists of a title, a picture, a list with the ingredients, a step-by-step guidance, the time that is needed and a difficulty level. The receipts will be assigned to different categories, for example dessert, dinner and drinks. New receipts can be added in the web application.

 * HTML Validator: [Validator](https://validator.nu/ "Validator")
 * Dialogs are mostly taken over from the course webfr
 * Tested with Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge

I'm particular proud of:
 * the update dialog, that makes it possible to edit not only the information of the recipe, but also the ingredients. This makes it possible to edit ingredients, add new ingredients and delete them.
 * working with a one-to-many relation for the grails domain classes.
